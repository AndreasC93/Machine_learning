###1. Load the Lending Club data, split the data into training and testing sets, and scale the features data.
2. Oversample the data using the `Naive Random Oversampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms.
3. Undersample the data using the `Cluster Centroids` algorithm.
4. Over- and under-sample using a combination `SMOTEENN` algorithm.

For each of the above, you will need to:

1. Train a `logistic regression classifier` from `sklearn.linear_model` using the resampled data.
2. Calculate the `balanced accuracy score` from `sklearn.metrics`.
3. Calculate the `confusion matrix` from `sklearn.metrics`.
4. Print the `imbalanced classification report` from `imblearn.metrics`.

Use the above to answer the following:

> Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
>
> Which model had the best recall score?
>
> Which model had the best geometric mean score?
